This code provides a foundation for addressing the various user stories through concrete implementations of:
- FABS data processing and validation
- Submission tracking and handling
- Resource management
- GTAS window management
- D File generation with caching
- Validation rule application
- Dashboard functionality
- Database management
- Error handling and reporting

Each component addresses aspects of the requirements while maintaining a cohesive structure that can scale and evolve with additional functionality.</pre>
