As an agency user, I want to upload a submission file with validations for DUNS, CFDA, and ZIP codes, so that invalid records are identified and corrected before processing.
As a validator, I want to accept expired DUNS for specific action types like B, C, D, so that legitimate submissions for base periods are not rejected unnecessarily.
As a file processor, I want to generate error files for invalid submissions, so that users can quickly review and fix issues in their data.
As a submission manager, I want to prevent duplicate uploads using file hashing, so that redundant processing is avoided and resources are saved.
As a publisher, I want to derive fields like FundingAgencyCode and PPoPCode during publishing, so that data quality is improved without manual intervention.
As a historical data loader, I want to load FABS data with derived FREC codes, so that legacy records are accurately integrated into the current system.
As a dashboard user, I want to view submission status labels differentiated by FABS or DABS, so that I can track progress without confusion between systems.
As an administrator, I want to handle deletions for specific dates, so that outdated or erroneous records can be removed from published awards.
As a data integrator, I want to sync daily financial data and filter out NASA grants from contracts, so that the dataset remains accurate and compliant.
As a tester, I want to generate sample FABS files without certain headers like FundingAgencyCode, so that testing aligns with v1.1 schema requirements.
As a report generator, I want to create user testing summaries and audits, so that stakeholders can review UX improvements and timelines effectively.
As a performance optimizer, I want to index database tables for submissions and awards, so that validation and queries run faster for large datasets.
As a file generator, I want to produce D1 and D files from combined FABS and FPDS data, so that downstream systems receive synchronized outputs.
As a security enforcer, I want to lock the site during GTAS windows, so that submissions are prevented during critical financial reporting periods.
As a data accessor, I want to download uploaded files and access raw agency files limited to grants, so that I can retrieve and audit specific records securely.
As an environment manager, I want to reset permissions to Staging MAX for FABS testers, so that testing occurs in a controlled and safe manner.
As a validation engineer, I want to handle flexfields up to 100 without performance impact and include them in errors, so that comprehensive data submissions are supported.
As a historical loader, I want to load FPDS data since 2007 with additional derived fields, so that long-term trends can be analyzed accurately.
As a UI supporter, I want status labels and banners to avoid cross-system confusion between FABS and DABS, so that user experience is intuitive and error-free.
As a loan processor, I want to accept zero or blank values for certain fields in loan records, so that financial assistance data is not incorrectly flagged.
