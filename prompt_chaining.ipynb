      "    *   **Upper Levels (Specialized/Intensive):** Could house light-intensive crops, or dedicated areas for seed propagation, nursery operations, or even specialty crops like medicinal plants.\n",
      "    *   **Specialty Modules:** Dedicated modules could support mushroom cultivation (darker, humid conditions), insect farming (sustainable protein), or the aforementioned aquaponics.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Intelligent Crop Rotation & Pest Management:**\n",
      "    *   **Automated Scheduling:** An AI-driven system manages crop rotation to prevent nutrient depletion in specific areas and mitigate pest buildup.\n",
      "    *   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Strict biosecurity protocols, beneficial insects (e.g., ladybugs for aphids), biological controls, and advanced air filtration eliminate the need for synthetic pesticides or herbicides.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Subscription Model & Access:**\n",
      "    *   **\"Hive Plot\" Subscriptions:** Residents subscribe to a specific \"plot\" or \"shelf space\" within a designated food group level, paying a monthly fee. Tiered pricing could offer different plot sizes or access to specialty crops.\n",
      "    *   **Secure Access:** Biometric or RFID access grants subscribers entry to their assigned level and plot during designated harvesting hours.\n",
      "    *   **Harvesting:** Residents personally harvest their fresh produce, connecting them directly to their food source.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Digital Interface & Community Platform:**\n",
      "    *   **Mobile App:** A dedicated app allows residents to:\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Hyper-Efficient Water Recycling:**\n",
      "    *   **Rainwater Harvesting:** The tower's roof and external surfaces are designed to capture and filter rainwater, storing it in large cisterns for primary use.\n",
      "    *   **Condensate Collection:** Water condensed from the tower's HVAC systems is collected and purified for reuse.\n",
      "    *   **Greywater Integration (Optional):** If integrated into a mixed-use development, treated greywater from residential units could be used for non-edible plant irrigation or toilet flushing, reducing overall municipal water demand.\n",
      "    *   **Minimal Evaporation:** The closed-loop hydroponic system inherently minimizes water loss compared to traditional agriculture (up to 95% less).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Circular Waste Management:**\n",
      "    *   **Organic Composting:** All non-edible plant matter, roots, and trimmings are collected and composted on-site using vermicomposting (worm farms) or small-scale anaerobic digesters.\n",
      "    *   **Nutrient Return:** The nutrient-rich compost or digestate can be used to enrich any integrated soil-based community gardens, or its liquid components can be re-introduced into the hydroponic system.\n",
      "    *   **Plastic Recycling:** Worn-out plastic components are collected and processed for industrial recycling, ensuring the lifecycle of materials.\n",
