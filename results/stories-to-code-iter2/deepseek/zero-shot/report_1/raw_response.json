As a system administrator, I want to configure database connections, so that the application can interact with the database securely and efficiently.  \n2. As a developer, I want to implement logging, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot application issues.  \n3. As an operations team member, I want to integrate New Relic monitoring, so that I can track application performance and errors.  \n4. As a data manager, I want to process deletions for a specific date, so that outdated records are marked as deleted in the database.  \n5. As a submission manager, I want to update the publish status of a submission, so that stakeholders can track the submission lifecycle.  \n6. As a file uploader, I want to generate a file hash, so that I can verify file integrity and uniqueness.  \n7. As a user, I want to upload files securely, so that my submissions are saved without naming conflicts or security risks.  \n8. As a validator, I want to validate FABS submission files, so that they meet required standards before processing.  \n9. As a testing coordinator, I want to generate user testing reports, so that I can document test results for agencies.  \n10. As a UI designer, I want to redesign the resources page, so that users can access documentation and support materials more easily.  \n11. As a visitor, I want to view the homepage, so that I can navigate to FABS or DABS sections.  \n12. As a user, I want to access the resources page, so that I can find documentation and submission guidelines.  \n13. As a submitter, I want to upload FABS submission files, so that my data can be processed and published.  \n14. As a user, I want to check the status of my submission, so that I know its current processing state.  \n15. As an API consumer, I want to retrieve published FABS files by date, so that I can access the required data programmatically.  \n16. As a validator, I want to validate D file content via API, so that I can ensure compliance before processing.  \n17. As a GTAS administrator, I want to set GTAS submission windows, so that submissions are only accepted during approved periods.  \n18. As a developer, I want to create an uploads directory automatically, so that file submissions can be saved without manual setup.",
