As a system administrator, I want to process deletions for a specific date, so that the system remains clean and up-to-date.\n2. As a data manager, I want to update the publication status of a FABS submission, so that users can track the progress of their submissions.\n3. As a data validator, I want to validate FABS files against a schema, so that the data conforms to required standards.\n4. As a developer, I want to generate a D file from FABS and FPDS data, so that data can be processed and shared efficiently.\n5. As a data analyst, I want to derive a funding agency code based on business rules, so that funding sources are accurately categorized.\n6. As a UI designer, I want to redesign the Resources page with new styles, so that the interface is modern and user-friendly.\n7. As a UX researcher, I want to create a user testing report for agencies, so that usability issues are documented and addressed.\n8. As a content manager, I want to update the Help page with new changes, so that users have access to the latest information.\n9. As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure New Relic monitoring for applications, so that system performance can be tracked.\n10. As a database administrator, I want to update validation rules in the database, so that data integrity is maintained.\n11. As a data processor, I want to add GTAS window data to the database, so that financial data is recorded accurately.\n12. As a data engineer, I want to load historical FABS data into the database, so that historical records are preserved and accessible.\n13. As a developer, I want to process flexfields for a submission, so that dynamic data fields are handled correctly.\n14. As a system administrator, I want to prevent users from double-publishing the same submission, so that data duplication is avoided.\n15. As an auditor, I want to generate an audit report for UI improvements, so that changes can be tracked and reviewed.\n16. As a data analyst, I want to derive a PPoP code based on business rules, so that program and project data is categorized correctly.\n17.
