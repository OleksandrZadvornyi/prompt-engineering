As a system administrator, I want to configure logging for the application, so that I can monitor system activities and troubleshoot issues.  \n2. As a user, I want to create a new FABS submission with an initial status, so that I can start the publication process.  \n3. As a user, I want to update the publish status of a FABS submission, so that I can track its progress through the workflow.  \n4. As a validator, I want to validate a FABS submission for required fields, so that I can ensure data quality before publication.  \n5. As a publisher, I want to publish a validated FABS submission, so that the data becomes available to stakeholders.  \n6. As a database administrator, I want to add and retrieve FABS submissions from the database, so that I can manage submission records efficiently.  \n7. As an administrator, I want to set a GTAS lock period, so that I can prevent modifications during critical windows.  \n8. As a user, I want to check if the GTAS is locked, so that I know if submissions can be modified.  \n9. As a data processor, I want to generate a D file from FABS and FPDS data, so that I can prepare data for further processing.  \n10. As a system monitor, I want to check if FPDS data is up-to-date, so that I can ensure data synchronization.  \n11. As a test manager, I want to schedule user testing sessions, so that I can organize evaluation activities.  \n12. As a tester, I want to record issues found during testing, so that developers can address them.  \n13. As a manager, I want to generate a test summary report, so that I can track testing progress and issues.  \n14. As a validator, I want to apply validation rules for fields like DUNS and PPoPCode, so that I can ensure data compliance.  \n15. As a UI designer, I want to update and approve page designs, so that the application's interface stays consistent and user-friendly.  \n16. As a data engineer, I want to load historical FABS and FPDS data, so that I can populate the system with legacy records.  \n17. As a system monitor, I want to track application metrics, so that I can monitor performance and usage.  \n18. As an administrator, I want to manage permissions for different environments, so that I can control access to staging and production.  \n19.
