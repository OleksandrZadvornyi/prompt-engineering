As a system administrator, I want to process deletions for a specific date, so that I can maintain data cleanliness and compliance.\n2. As a user, I want to update the publish status of my submission, so that I can track its progress through the system.\n3. As a FABS user, I want to validate my file before submission, so that I can ensure it meets all requirements.\n4. As a user, I want to generate a D file for my submission, so that I can have the required output format.\n5. As a system, I want to check if FPDS data has changed, so that I can avoid unnecessary regeneration of D files.\n6. As a user, I want to get published FABS files, so that I can access completed submissions.\n7. As a user, I want to add flexfields to my submission efficiently, so that I can include additional data without performance issues.\n8. As a system, I want to prevent double publishing of submissions, so that I can maintain data integrity.\n9. As a user, I want to derive office names from office codes, so that I can display meaningful information.\n10. As an administrator, I want to update validation rules, so that I can ensure data quality meets current requirements.\n11. As a system administrator, I want to lock the site during GTAS periods, so that I can prevent data changes during critical processing windows.\n12. As a user, I want to check if the site is locked for GTAS, so that I know when I can perform submissions.\n13. As an administrator, I want to update the sample file link for FABS, so that users have access to the latest template.\n14. As a system, I want to log submission activities, so that I can maintain an audit trail of changes.\n15. As a tester, I want to generate user testing reports, so that I can document test results for agencies.\n16. As a UI designer, I want to update the Resources page, so that users have an improved experience.\n17. As a user, I want to get the creator of a submission, so that I can contact them if needed.\n18.
