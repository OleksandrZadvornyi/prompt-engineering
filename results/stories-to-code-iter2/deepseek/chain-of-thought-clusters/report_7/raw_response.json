As a Data Processor, I want to process deletions for a specific date, so that I can maintain clean and up-to-date records.  \n2. As a UI Designer, I want to redesign the Resources page, so that it matches the new Broker styles.  \n3. As a UI Designer, I want to report user testing results to agencies, so that they can provide feedback and improvements.  \n4. As a DevOps Engineer, I want to configure New Relic for all applications, so that I can monitor performance and troubleshoot issues.  \n5. As a Broker User, I want to sync D1 file generation with FPDS data load, so that data consistency is maintained.  \n6. As a Broker Team Member, I want to update SQL codes for clarity, so that queries are easier to understand and maintain.  \n7. As a Broker Team Member, I want to add 00***** and 00FORGN PPoPCode cases, so that special cases are properly handled.  \n8. As a Broker Team Member, I want to derive FundingAgencyCode, so that data quality is improved.  \n9. As an Agency User, I want to map FederalActionObligation to Atom Feed, so that financial data is accurately represented.  \n10.

As a Developer, I want to improve logging for troubleshooting, so that issues can be diagnosed faster.  \n12. As a Developer, I want to ensure domain models are indexed, so that validation is faster.  \n13. As a Website User, I want to access published FABS files, so that I can download and analyze data.  \n14. As an Owner, I want to set up user testing based on SME input, so that feedback is incorporated early.  \n15. As an Owner, I want to reset the environment to staging permissions, so that testing remains consistent.  \n16. As a FABS User, I want to request read-only access to DABS, so that I can review submission data.  \n17. As a FABS Developer, I want to update FABS submission status, so that workflows are correctly tracked.  \n18. As a FABS Developer, I want to load GTAS window data to the database, so that financial reporting is accurate.  \n19.

As a Historical Data Loader, I want to include FREC derivations in historical data, so that records are complete.  \n21. As a Validation Manager, I want to update validation rules, so that they align with business requirements.  \n22. As a Validation Manager, I want to prevent duplicate transactions from being published, so that data integrity is maintained.  \n23. As a File Manager, I want to cache D File generation requests, so that repeated processing is minimized.  \n24. As a File Manager, I want to prevent double publishing FABS submissions, so that data consistency is ensured.  \n25. As an Agency Data User, I want to validate FABS rules for loan/non-loan records, so that compliance is enforced.  \n26. As an Agency Data User, I want to ensure SAM data is complete, so that records are accurate and reliable.  \n27. As a Cross-Cluster Team Member, I want to derive office names from codes, so that display names are user-friendly.  \n28. As a Cross-Cluster Team Member, I want to update the sample file link to point to the correct file, so that users download the latest version.  \n29. As a Cross-Cluster Team Member, I want to handle ZIP codes missing last 4 digits, so that partial entries are processed correctly.  \n30. As a Cross-Cluster Team Member, I want to update status labels for the Submission Dashboard, so that progress is clearly communicated.",
