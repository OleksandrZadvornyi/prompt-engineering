As a Data Administrator, I want to process deletions for a specific date, so that outdated data is removed from the system.  \n2. As a UI Designer, I want to redesign the Resources page to match new Broker design styles, so that the UI remains consistent and modern.  \n3. As a UI Designer, I want to report user testing results to Agencies, so that feedback can be incorporated into design improvements.  \n4. As a DevOps Engineer, I want to configure New Relic for specified applications, so that system performance can be monitored effectively.  \n5. As a Database Administrator, I want to update SQL codes for clarity, so that queries are more maintainable and easier to debug.  \n6. As a Database Administrator, I want to add PPoPCode cases to derivation logic, so that special cases like 00***** and 00FORGN are handled correctly.  \n7. As a Database Administrator, I want to derive FundingAgencyCode, so that data quality is improved.  \n8. As a Data Mapper, I want to map FederalActionObligation to Atom Feed, so that financial data is accurately represented.  \n9. As a Data Validator, I want to validate PPoP ZIP+4 codes, so that they meet the same standards as Legal Entity ZIP validations.  \n10. As a Content Editor, I want to edit landing pages for specific rounds, so that information remains up-to-date and relevant.  \n11. As a System Administrator, I want to enhance logging for specific submissions, so that debugging and auditing are more efficient.  \n12. As a Content Creator, I want to create mockups for Broker users, so that new designs can be reviewed before implementation.  \n13. As a Testing Coordinator, I want to schedule user testing with advanced notice, so that participants are prepared and available.  \n14. As a Testing Coordinator, I want to conduct user testing for specified test cases, so that usability issues can be identified and addressed.  \n15. As a Security Administrator, I want to restrict permissions to only allow Staging MAX permissions, so that production environments remain secure.  \n16. As a FABS Manager, I want to update FABS submissions when publishStatus changes, so that data remains synchronized.  \n17. As a FABS Manager, I want to deactivate the publish button during derivations, so that incomplete data is not published prematurely.  \n18. As a FABS Manager, I want to update frontend URLs to reflect the current page accurately, so that navigation remains reliable.  \n19. As a Validation Manager, I want to update error message text for accuracy, so that users receive clear and helpful feedback.  \n20. As a Validation Manager, I want to prevent duplicate transactions from being published, so that data integrity is maintained.  \n21. As a File Manager, I want to cache D Files generation requests, so that duplicate processing is avoided.  \n22. As a File Manager, I want to prevent double publishing of FABS submissions, so that data consistency is ensured.  \n23. As a Deployment Engineer, I want to deploy FABS to production, so that new features and fixes are available to users.  \n24. As a Data Analyst, I want to derive office names from office codes, so that data reporting is more readable.  \n25. As a Content Editor, I want to update SAMPLE FILE links in dialogs, so that users can access the correct resources.  \n26. As a Data Processor, I want to handle ZIP codes missing last 4 digits, so that partial ZIP data is still usable.  \n27.
