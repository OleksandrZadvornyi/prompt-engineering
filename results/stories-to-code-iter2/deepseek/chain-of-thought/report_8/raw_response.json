As a system administrator, I want to configure logging for submissions, so that all activities are properly recorded for auditing and debugging.  \n2. As a submission manager, I want to track the publish status of submissions, so that I can monitor their lifecycle from draft to published or failed.  \n3. As a data submitter, I want to update the publish status of a submission, so that its state reflects the latest changes accurately.  \n4. As a validator, I want to add validation errors to a submission, so that issues can be tracked and resolved.  \n5. As a reviewer, I want to retrieve validation errors for a submission, so that I can assess its compliance with requirements.  \n6. As a data entry specialist, I want to add flexible fields to a submission, so that additional metadata can be included.  \n7. As a FABS submitter, I want to upload a file for a submission, so that it can be processed and validated.  \n8. As a FABS validator, I want to validate a submission file, so that I can ensure it meets the required format and content standards.  \n9. As a publisher, I want to publish a FABS submission, so that it moves from draft to published status if validation passes.  \n10. As a DABS submitter, I want to sync FPDS data with a submission, so that it includes the latest procurement information.  \n11. As a DABS processor, I want to generate a D file for a submission, so that it can be used for downstream reporting.  \n12. As a UI designer, I want to redesign a page, so that the user interface can be improved based on feedback.  \n13. As a UX researcher, I want to conduct user testing, so that I can gather feedback on design changes.  \n14.
