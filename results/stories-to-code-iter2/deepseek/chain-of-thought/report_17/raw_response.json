As a system administrator, I want to configure logging, so that system activities and errors are properly recorded and monitored.  \n2. As a data submitter, I want to track the status of my submission, so that I know its current state in the publishing workflow.  \n3. As a data validator, I want to validate a submission, so that I can ensure data quality before publishing.  \n4. As a data manager, I want to update a FABS submission status, so that I can reflect its current state in the system.  \n5. As a system operator, I want to set a GTAS window, so that I can lock down the system during sensitive periods.  \n6. As a data processor, I want to generate a D file for a submission, so that I can create standardized output files for FABS/FPDS data.  \n7. As a publisher, I want to prevent double publishing of submissions, so that I avoid duplicate data in the system.  \n8. As a UI designer, I want to redesign the Resources page, so that it matches the new Broker styles.  \n9. As a UX researcher, I want to report user testing results to agencies, so that we can gather feedback on system usability.  \n10. As a testing coordinator, I want to schedule user testing sessions, so that we can evaluate system improvements.  \n11. As a technical lead, I want to track Tech Thursday issues, so that we can address system problems identified during the session.  \n12. As a data steward, I want to process deletions for a specific date, so that I can maintain data integrity by removing outdated records.  \n13. As a system user, I want to create different types of submissions (FABS/DABS/FPDS), so that I can submit various kinds of financial data.  \n14. As a validator, I want to check submission-specific rules for FABS, so that I can ensure FABS data meets its unique requirements.  \n15.
