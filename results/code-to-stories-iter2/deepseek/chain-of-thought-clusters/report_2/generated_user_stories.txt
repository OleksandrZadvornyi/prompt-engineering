Here are the user stories derived from the Python code:

1. As a user, I want to create a submission with title, description, and agency, so that I can submit my data for processing.  
2. As a user, I want my submission to be validated against required fields and length constraints, so that I ensure it meets the system requirements.  
3. As a user, I want to publish my validated submission, so that it is saved in the database.  
4. As a user, I want to sync data with FPDS, so that my system is up-to-date with external records.  
5. As a user, I want to process historical FABS data, so that I can work with past records.  
6. As a user, I want to derive FREC codes from agency data, so that I can classify submissions correctly.  
7. As a user, I want to derive funding agency codes from submission data, so that I can categorize funding sources.  
8. As a user, I want to process deletions for records, so that I can manage data cleanup.  
9. As a user, I want to generate a D file from submissions, so that I can export data for reporting.  
10. As a user, I want to schedule a test, so that I can validate system functionality.  
11. As a user, I want to record test issues, so that I can track and resolve bugs.  
12. As a user, I want to generate a test summary, so that I can review testing progress and results.  
13. As a system administrator, I want to manage validation rules (required fields, max lengths), so that I can enforce data quality standards.  
14. As a tester, I want to validate submissions before publishing, so that I ensure only correct data enters the system.  
15. As a developer, I want an end-to-end submission processing workflow, so that I can handle submissions efficiently.
