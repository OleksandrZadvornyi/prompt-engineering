Here are the user stories derived from the Python code:

1. As a developer, I want to implement an ErrorHandler class to validate data fields, so that I can ensure data quality and consistency.  
2. As a system administrator, I want to use the FileHandler class to read CSV and JSON files, so that I can process different file formats uniformly.  
3. As a developer, I want to validate file extensions before processing, so that I can prevent errors from unsupported file types.  
4. As a data engineer, I want to cache frequently accessed data using DataCache, so that I can improve system performance.  
5. As a submission manager, I want to track submission statuses using SubmissionManager, so that I can monitor the progress of data processing.  
6. As a data processor, I want to log deletion tasks in DataProcessor, so that I can manage data retention policies.  
7. As an agency data analyst, I want to derive agency codes with AgencyDataHandler, so that I can standardize agency references.  
8. As a UI designer, I want to manage page versions with UIPageManager, so that I can track changes and updates to UI content.  
9. As a QA tester, I want to record test results with QATester, so that I can validate UI functionality.  
10. As a broker user, I want to process submissions with BrokerUser, so that I can validate, extract, and standardize data from files.  
11. As a UI manager, I want to update page designs with UIManager, so that I can maintain and improve the user interface.  
12. As a system user, I want to process files with error handling using SystemUser, so that I can handle failures gracefully.  
13. As a developer, I want to ensure the ErrorHandler returns detailed validation failures, so that users can easily debug issues.  
14. As a submission handler, I want to create and update submission statuses, so that I can keep track of data processing states.  
15. As a data manager, I want to handle CSV and JSON file parsing, so that I can work with structured data efficiently.  
16. As a user, I want the system to return meaningful error messages for invalid files, so that I can correct issues quickly.  
17. As a tester, I want to retrieve test results for specific pages, so that I can verify UI functionality.  
18. As an administrator, I want to manage cached data, so that I can optimize system performance.  
19. As a developer, I want to validate data before processing, so that I can prevent corrupt or invalid data from being used.  
20. As a UI developer, I want to version-control page updates, so that I can track and rollback changes if needed.
