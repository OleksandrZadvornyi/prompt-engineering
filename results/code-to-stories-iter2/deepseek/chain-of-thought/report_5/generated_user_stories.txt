Here are the user stories derived from the Python code:

1. As a data contributor, I want to submit data with validation, so that only correct data is processed.  
2. As a user, I want to apply specific validation rules to my submission, so that I can ensure data meets certain criteria.  
3. As a system administrator, I want to track submission statuses (DRAFT, PENDING, APPROVED, etc.), so that I can manage workflows effectively.  
4. As a designer, I want to create and version UI designs, so that I can track changes and iterations.  
5. As a designer, I want to submit design versions for approval, so that they can be reviewed before publishing.  
6. As a data manager, I want to delete records by date, so that I can clean up old or irrelevant data.  
7. As a user, I want to retrieve published files by type, so that I can access approved content.  
8. As a developer, I want to log submission actions, so that I can monitor and debug the system.  
9. As a validator, I want to define custom validation rules with error messages, so that I can enforce data quality standards.  
10. As an approver, I want to see pending submissions, so that I can review and approve/reject them.  
11. As a user, I want to perform different actions (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.) on submissions, so that I can manage content flexibly.  
12. As a system, I want to auto-generate submission IDs with timestamps, so that each submission is uniquely identifiable.
