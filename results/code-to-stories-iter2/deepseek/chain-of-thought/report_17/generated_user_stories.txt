Here are the user stories derived from the Python code:

1. As a user, I want to create a new submission, so that I can start the data submission process.  
2. As a user, I want to update the status of my submission, so that I can track its progress through the workflow.  
3. As a user, I want to validate a FABS submission, so that I can ensure the data meets FABS requirements.  
4. As a user, I want to validate a DABS submission, so that I can ensure the data meets DABS requirements.  
5. As a data manager, I want to update a submission's status, so that I can manage its lifecycle correctly.  
6. As a system administrator, I want to set a GTAS window, so that I can close the system for updates or maintenance.  
7. As a system administrator, I want to clear a GTAS window, so that I can reopen the system for normal operations.  
8. As a data processor, I want to generate a D file for a validated submission, so that I can prepare the data for further processing.  
9. As a publisher, I want to publish a validated submission, so that the data becomes publicly available.  
10. As a UI designer, I want to redesign the resources page, so that it adheres to the new style guide.  
11. As a UX researcher, I want to report user testing results to an agency, so that feedback can be incorporated.  
12. As a testing coordinator, I want to schedule a user testing session, so that usability can be evaluated.  
13. As a tech lead, I want to log technical issues, so that they can be addressed in future meetings.  
14. As a tech lead, I want to retrieve logged technical issues, so that I can review them with the team.  
15. As a data steward, I want to process deletions for a specific date, so that outdated or incorrect data is removed.  

These user stories align with the functions and classes in the provided Python code. Let me know if you'd like any refinements!
