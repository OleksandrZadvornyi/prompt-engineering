Here are the user stories derived from the Python code:

1. As a content submitter, I want to create a new submission with an ID and content, so that I can track my submission in the system.  
2. As a content reviewer, I want to add issues (errors/warnings) to a submission, so that I can document problems that need to be addressed.  
3. As a content manager, I want to update the status of a submission (e.g., DRAFT, PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED), so that I can track its workflow progress.  
4. As a system administrator, I want to lock or unlock a submission, so that I can prevent or allow further modifications.  
5. As a data manager, I want to process deletions for a specific date, so that I can maintain data hygiene.  
6. As a system integrator, I want to sync D1 file generation with FPDS data, so that reports stay up to date.  
7. As a validation specialist, I want to update validation rules, so that data quality checks remain current.  
8. As a cache manager, I want to manage D Files cache, so that users access the most recent data efficiently.  
9. As a UI designer, I want to redesign the Resources page, so that users have an improved interface.  
10. As a UX researcher, I want to report user testing results to agencies, so that stakeholders can review feedback.  
11. As a design approver, I want to approve or reject design changes, so that only validated UI updates go live.  
12. As a file validator, I want to validate FABS submission files, so that uploaded data meets quality standards.  
13. As a report generator, I want to generate D Files from FABS and FPDS data, so that users can access processed reports.  
14. As a data analyst, I want to load historical FPDS data for analysis, so that I can generate insights.  
15. As a data analyst, I want to load historical FABS data for analysis, so that I can track submission trends.  
16. As an application user, I want to run a complete workflow (submissions, validation, reporting, etc.), so that I can perform all necessary operations efficiently.  

Each user story follows the format: **"As a [role], I want to [action], so that [benefit]."**
