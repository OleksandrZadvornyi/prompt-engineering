Here are the user stories derived from the Python code:  

1. As a **Data Administrator**, I want to **delete data for a specific date**, so that **I can maintain accurate and up-to-date records**.  
2. As a **System Validator**, I want to **validate date formats**, so that **data consistency is maintained across the application**.  
3. As a **UX Designer**, I want to **redesign a page with new styles**, so that **I can improve the user interface and experience**.  
4. As a **Test Engineer**, I want to **report test results to an agency**, so that **compliance and functionality can be verified**.  
5. As a **Design Manager**, I want to **submit design changes for approval**, so that **updates are tracked and reviewed before deployment**.  
6. As a **Submission Tracker**, I want to **track the publish status of a submission**, so that **I can monitor progress and completion**.  
7. As a **Data Analyst**, I want to **add derived fields to submissions**, so that **enhanced data insights can be generated**.  
8. As a **Validation Manager**, I want to **update validation rules**, so that **data integrity standards are enforced**.  
9. As a **Support Specialist**, I want to **get error descriptions for codes**, so that **I can assist users with troubleshooting**.  
10. As a **Data Processor**, I want to **generate a D-file (CSV) from structured data**, so that **I can export reports in a standardized format**.  
11. As a **System Monitor**, I want to **check for FPDS updates**, so that **I can ensure the latest data is being used**.  
12. As a **File Validator**, I want to **validate file extensions**, so that **only permitted file types are processed**.  
13. As a **Data Loader**, I want to **load historical FPDS data**, so that **I can perform trend analysis**.
