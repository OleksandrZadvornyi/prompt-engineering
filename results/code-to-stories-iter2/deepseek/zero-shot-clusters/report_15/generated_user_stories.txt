Here are the user stories derived from the Python code:

1. As a Database Administrator, I want to delete records older than a specified date, so that the database remains optimized and contains only relevant data.  
2. As a Data Analyst, I want to sync D1 file generation with FPDS data load, so that data remains consistent across systems.  
3. As a System Administrator, I want to derive PPoP codes according to business logic, so that special codes are correctly identified and processed.  
4. As a Financial Analyst, I want to derive FundingAgencyCode from raw data, so that funding sources are standardized and properly formatted.  
5. As a Data Mapper, I want to map FederalActionObligation to Atom Feed format, so that financial data is presented in a structured and consumable way.  
6. As a Form Validator, I want to validate ZIP codes (with or without +4 extension), so that address data is accurate and properly formatted.  
7. As a Submission Manager, I want to update submissions when publishStatus changes, so that the system reflects the latest state of submissions.  
8. As a System Administrator, I want to lock the site during a specified period, so that GTAS submissions are not interrupted.  
9. As a File Processor, I want to remove FundingAgencyCode from FABS sample files, so that the files comply with updated data standards.  
10. As a UI Developer, I want to enable/disable the publish button during derivations, so that users cannot submit incomplete or invalid data.  
11. As a Data Historian, I want to derive fields for historical FABS data, so that records maintain accurate processing metadata.  
12. As a Data Historian, I want to include FREC derivations in historical data, so that financial records are complete and traceable.  
13. As a Validation Engineer, I want to update validation rules dynamically, so that data quality checks remain effective and up-to-date.  
14. As a File Manager, I want to cache and manage D Files generation requests, so that processing is efficient and avoids redundant operations.  
15. As a Submission Auditor, I want to prevent duplicate FABS publishing, so that data integrity is maintained.  
16. As a UI Developer, I want to update header information with the current date and time, so that users have real-time context.  
17. As a Support Engineer, I want to update error codes with clearer descriptions, so that troubleshooting is more efficient.  
18. As a Form Validator, I want to validate partial ZIP codes (without last 4 digits), so that incomplete entries are still usable for basic address verification.
