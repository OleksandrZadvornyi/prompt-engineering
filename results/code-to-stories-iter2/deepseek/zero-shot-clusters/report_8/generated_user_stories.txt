2. As a Database Developer, I want to reformat SQL files for better readability, so that SQL queries are easier to maintain and understand.  
3. As a Data Analyst, I want to derive PPoPCode with additional cases, so that we can handle more input variations in our data processing.  
4. As a UI Designer, I want to add user feedback for the current round, so that we can collect and organize user input systematically.  
5. As a UI Designer, I want to advance to the next feedback round, so that we can manage feedback in distinct phases.

8. As a Frontend Developer, I want to toggle the derivation state, so that I can simulate backend processing for UI testing.  
9. As a Frontend Developer, I want to determine if the publish button should be enabled, so that users can only publish when derivation is complete.  
10. As a Data Validator, I want to validate DUNS numbers with expanded rules, so that we ensure only properly formatted numbers are accepted.  
11. As a System Architect, I want to generate D Files with caching, so that frequently accessed files are generated efficiently.
