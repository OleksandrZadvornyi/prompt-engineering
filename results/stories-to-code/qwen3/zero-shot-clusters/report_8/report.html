As a user, I want to generate and validate D Files from FABS and FPDS data. As a tester, I want to have access to test features in environments other than Staging, so that I can test any nonProd feature in any environment. As a FABS user, I want to submission errors to accurately represent FABS errors, so that I know why my submission didn&#x27;t work. As an Agency user, I want to accurately see who created a submission, so that I&#x27;m not confused about who last updated a submission. As a tester, I want to ensure that FABS is deriving fields properly through a robust test file plus a follow up check. As a Broker user, I want to submit records for individual recipients without receiving a DUNS error. As a user, I want more information about how many rows will be published prior to deciding whether to publish. As a FABS user, I want to submit a citywide as a PPoPZIP and pass validations. As a FABS user, I want to have my validations run in a reasonable amount of time.

Cluster (3,):
As an data user, I want to receive updates to FABS records. As an agency user, I want to ensure that deleted FSRS records are not included in submissions. As an agency user, I want the FABS validation rules to accept zero and blank for loan records. As an Agency user, I want FABS deployed into production, so I can submit my Financial Assistance data. As an agency user, I want to be confident that the data coming from SAM is complete. As an agency user, I want the FABS validation rules to accept zero and blank for non-loan records. As an agency user, I want to have all derived data elements derived properly. As an agency user, I want the maximum length allowed for LegalEntityAddressLine3 to match Schema v1.1. As an agency user, I want to use the schema v1.1 headers in my FABS file. As an Agency user, I want FPDS data to be up-to-date daily. As an Agency user, I want all historical Financial Assistance data loaded for FABS go-live. As an Agency user, I want historical FPDS data loaded. As an agency user, I want to get File F in the correct format. As an Agency user, I want to better understand my file-level errors. As an agency user, I want to submit my data elements surrounded by quotation marks, so that Excel won&#x27;t strip off leading and trailing zeroes.

Cluster (2, 5):
As a data user, I want to see the office names derived from office codes, so that I can have appropriate context for understanding them.

Cluster (2, 4, 5):
As a FABS user, I want to link the SAMPLE FILE on the &quot;What you want  to submit&quot; dialog to point to the correct file, so that I have an accurate reference for my agency submissions.

Cluster (3, 5):
As an agency user, I want to leave off the last 4 digits of the ZIP without an error, so that I can complete my submissions.

Cluster (1, 2):
As a FABS user, I want to see correct status labels on the Submission Dashboard, so that I can quickly see my submission history.
