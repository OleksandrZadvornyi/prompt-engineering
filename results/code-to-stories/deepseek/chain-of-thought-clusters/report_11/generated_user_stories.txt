Here are the user stories derived from the Python code:

1. As a user, I want to create a submission with a specific status, so that I can track its progress through different stages.

2. As a user, I want to update the publication status of a submission, so that I can reflect its current state in the system.

3. As a system administrator, I want to log status changes for submissions, so that I can maintain an audit trail of modifications.

4. As a user, I want to check if a GTAS window is currently active, so that I can determine if certain time-sensitive operations are allowed.

5. As a data validator, I want to validate a DUNS number based on action type, so that I can ensure compliance with business rules.

6. As a data validator, I want to validate ZIP codes with optional short-form acceptance, so that I can enforce address formatting standards.

7. As a data analyst, I want to load historical FPDS data, so that I can perform analysis on past records.

8. As a data processor, I want to derive funding agency codes from records, so that I can standardize agency references.

9. As a UI developer, I want to update header information boxes with timestamps, so that users see when data was last refreshed.

10. As a UI developer, I want to retrieve landing page navigation options, so that I can present available system modules to users.

11. As an API consumer, I want to retrieve D files with optional caching, so that I can efficiently access frequently-used data.

12. As an API consumer, I want to force regeneration of cached D files, so that I can ensure I'm working with the most current data.
