Here are the user stories derived from the Python code:

1. As a user, I want to create a submission, so that I can submit my data for processing.  
2. As a user, I want to validate my submission against rules, so that I can ensure my data is correct before submission.  
3. As a user, I want to publish my submission if it is valid, so that my data can be processed.  
4. As an admin, I want to update validation rules, so that I can maintain data quality standards.  
5. As a system, I want to load validation rules from the database, so that I can enforce current validation criteria.  
6. As a data manager, I want to generate a D file, so that I can export submission data for external use.  
7. As a data manager, I want to sync with FPDS data, so that I can ensure my files are up to date.  
8. As a data processor, I want to process historical FABS data, so that I can include it in reports.  
9. As a data processor, I want to derive FREC codes, so that I can properly categorize agency data.  
10. As an admin, I want to update the GTAS window, so that I can control the data processing timeframe.  
11. As an agency user, I want to check the current submission period, so that I know when to submit my data.  
12. As an agency user, I want to validate ZIP codes, so that I can ensure address data is correct.  
13. As an agency user, I want to format File F data, so that it meets submission requirements.  
14. As a data quality analyst, I want to derive funding agency codes, so that records are properly categorized.  
15. As a data quality analyst, I want to process deletions, so that outdated data is marked appropriately.  
16. As a UI tester, I want to schedule user testing, so that we can evaluate the system's usability.  
17. As a UI tester, I want to record test issues, so that we can track and fix problems.  
18. As a UI tester, I want to generate a test summary, so that we can analyze testing results.  
19. As a system, I want to process a user submission end-to-end, so that all validation and publishing steps are completed.
