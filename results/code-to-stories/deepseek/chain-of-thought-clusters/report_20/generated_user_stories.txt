Here are the user stories derived from the Python code:

1. As a **developer**, I want to **create and manage user accounts with roles**, so that **different users have appropriate access levels**.  
2. As a **system administrator**, I want to **manage agency records**, so that **users can be associated with their respective agencies**.  
3. As an **agency user**, I want to **submit data with different statuses (draft, validated, published)**, so that **I can track the progress of my submissions**.  
4. As a **developer**, I want to **track submission timestamps**, so that **I can monitor when submissions are created or updated**.  
5. As a **data manager**, I want to **define and update validation rules**, so that **data quality is enforced for submissions**.  
6. As a **data analyst**, I want to **validate DUNS numbers based on action type**, so that **only valid records are processed further**.  
7. As a **system administrator**, I want to **load historical FPDS data**, so that **past records are available for reference**.  
8. As a **developer**, I want to **generate D-files for validated submissions**, so that **data can be exported in a structured format**.  
9. As a **UI designer**, I want to **submit UI update requests for approval**, so that **changes to the interface are tracked and managed**.  
10. As a **product manager**, I want to **review UI update requests by page**, so that **I can prioritize and approve updates efficiently**.  
11. As a **data engineer**, I want to **derive additional fields for FABS submissions**, so that **processed data is enriched before publishing**.  
12. As a **developer**, I want to **track the publication status of submissions**, so that **I can ensure data is only published when ready**.  
13. As an **agency user**, I want to **mark submissions as historical**, so that **older data can be archived without deletion**.  
14. As a **developer**, I want to **use enums for standardized statuses and actions**, so that **the system maintains consistency in workflow states**.  
15. As a **system administrator**, I want to **use foreign keys to enforce relationships between tables**, so that **data integrity is maintained**.
