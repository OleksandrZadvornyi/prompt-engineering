Here are the user stories derived from the Python code:

1. As a system administrator, I want to manage user accounts with different roles, so that access control can be properly enforced.  
2. As a broker user, I want to create new submissions (FABS/DABS), so that I can submit financial data for processing.  
3. As a broker user, I want to publish my submission, so that the data can be processed and made available.  
4. As a system, I want to track submission status (draft/published/failed), so that users can understand the state of their submissions.  
5. As a system, I want to validate DABS submissions for required fields like DUNS number, so that data quality is maintained.  
6. As a system, I want to automatically derive FABS-specific fields like FundingAgencyCode, so that submissions are properly enriched.  
7. As a developer, I want to cache D files, so that frequently accessed data can be retrieved quickly.  
8. As a data analyst, I want to set GTAS window periods, so that data processing can be time-bound.  
9. As a UI designer, I want to schedule user testing sessions, so that interface improvements can be validated.  
10. As a tester, I want to report UI issues with components, so that bugs can be tracked and fixed.  
11. As a UI designer, I want to generate testing reports, so that I can analyze test results.  
12. As a data engineer, I want to load historical FABS data with derived fields, so that legacy data can be processed consistently.  
13. As a data engineer, I want to load FPDS data with historical records filter, so that I can control which data is processed.  
14. As a developer, I want comprehensive logging for all system actions, so that issues can be diagnosed.  
15. As a broker user, I want to track errors and warnings on my submissions, so that I can address problems.  
16. As a system, I want to maintain submission timestamps (created/updated), so that activity can be audited.
