Here are the user stories derived from the provided Python code:  

1. As a **system administrator**, I want to **set up logging**, so that **I can monitor and troubleshoot application behavior**.  
2. As a **developer**, I want to **track submission status changes**, so that **I can maintain an audit trail of updates**.  
3. As a **data analyst**, I want to **validate submissions**, so that **I can ensure data quality before processing**.  
4. As a **user**, I want to **create a new submission**, so that **I can submit data for processing**.  
5. As a **user**, I want to **publish a submission**, so that **I can finalize and share it with the system**.  
6. As a **developer**, I want to **check user permissions**, so that **I can enforce role-based access control**.  
7. As a **data loader**, I want to **retrieve FPDS or FABS data**, so that **I can process submissions with external data sources**.  
8. As a **system administrator**, I want to **add users to the system**, so that **I can manage access control**.  
9. As a **user**, I want to **retrieve a submission**, so that **I can review or modify it**.  
10. As a **data processor**, I want to **generate a D file for a submission**, so that **I can prepare it for further processing**.  
11. As a **developer**, I want to **cache generated D files**, so that **I can optimize performance for repeated access**.  
12. As a **user**, I want to **update flex fields in a submission**, so that **I can add metadata without performance issues**.  
13. As a **system administrator**, I want to **limit the number of flex fields**, so that **I can prevent performance degradation**.  

Each user story encapsulates a feature or functionality described in the code while following the standard format. Let me know if you'd like any refinements!
