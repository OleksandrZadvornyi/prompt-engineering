1. As a system administrator, I want to configure logging for the application, so that I can monitor system activities and troubleshoot issues.  
2. As a user, I want to create a new FABS submission with an initial status, so that I can start the publication process.  
3. As a user, I want to update the publish status of a FABS submission, so that I can track its progress through the workflow.  
4. As a validator, I want to validate a FABS submission for required fields, so that I can ensure data quality before publication.  
5. As a publisher, I want to publish a validated FABS submission, so that the data becomes available to stakeholders.  
6. As a database administrator, I want to add and retrieve FABS submissions from the database, so that I can manage submission records efficiently.  
7. As an administrator, I want to set a GTAS lock period, so that I can prevent modifications during critical windows.  
8. As a user, I want to check if the GTAS is locked, so that I know if submissions can be modified.  
9. As a data processor, I want to generate a D file from FABS and FPDS data, so that I can prepare data for further processing.
